- Extract the code in the setTimeout function and replace the setTimeout function  with the extracted code. Then run the main script. 
- Is there a difference in the flow of execution from when the code was in the setTimeout function?
- Is the flow of execution in both these examples different from the flow of execution with the examples using the fetch() API, which also returns a promise? 
- If yes, explain the code execution difference. Add your explanation to this file.






    # Execution Flow Differences

## Direct Promise Execution (No setTimeout)
1. Promise executor runs synchronously
2. Computation happens immediately
3. Promise resolves/rejects in the same event loop cycle
4. .then/.catch handlers are scheduled for the next microtask queue

## With setTimeout
1. Promise executor runs synchronously
2. setTimeout callback is scheduled for the next macrotask queue
3. Computation is deferred
4. Promise remains pending until the next event loop cycle
5. .then/.catch handlers execute after the setTimeout callback

## fetch() API
1. Promise executor runs synchronously
2. Network request is initiated immediately
3. Promise remains pending until network response
4. Actual I/O happens asynchronously in the background
5. .then/.catch handlers execute only after network completion

The key difference is that fetch() involves real asynchronous I/O operations, while setTimeout artificially defers execution. The version without setTimeout performs synchronous computation but still maintains the promise interface for consistency.

In the context of sum2DArray:
- The direct version is more appropriate since there's no actual async operation
- The setTimeout version was just simulating async behavior
- fetch() would be used when real network operations are needed
